## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure across multiple marketing channels using machine learning techniques in Python. The objective is to analyze historical advertising data, build a regression model, and deploy the trained model as an interactive Streamlit web application.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, covering data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The work is divided into two major components:
1. Data Analysis & Model Development (Jupyter Notebook)  
2. Model Deployment using Streamlit
